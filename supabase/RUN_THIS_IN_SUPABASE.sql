-- Stock is owned by the database from here on.
--
-- products.quantity_in_stock used to be a counter that six screens rewrote
-- from numbers loaded when the page opened: sales from another phone were
-- overwritten, an oversold quantity was clamped away, returns re-added units
-- that had never come off, and a purchase could be saved without its stock
-- arriving. Now the ledgers are the truth — stock_purchases (in),
-- invoice_items (out) and stock_adjustments (counts and corrections) — and
-- triggers keep the counter in step atomically, from any device. Deleting or
-- shrinking a sale line gives the units back by itself; a purchase row adds
-- them by itself. The counter may go below zero (sold before the purchase
-- was booked); the app shows anything at or below zero as "Out of stock".
--
-- Nothing else may write the counter: a guard trigger ignores direct writes
-- (the old app's read-modify-write, a stale browser tab, a hand edit in the
-- table editor), so this file can run before or after the app update without

-- version reads products.track_stock). Safe to re-run: every run ends by

-- Expenses such as "zain 25000" or "Zain ko dea 5000"). Now every salary
-- payment is a row here, for one employee and one month (YYYY-MM). A month
-- may hold several rows (advances, part payments); its status is derived:
-- Paid when the payments add up to the salary due, Partial below that,
-- Unpaid when there are none.
